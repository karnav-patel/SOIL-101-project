              <p>Soil is the cornerstone of our current and past society. Soil provides the basis for which we build our homes, businesses, and communities. Investigating our soil can show how well a society functions. Soil can be used to look back into history as discussed in the book Soil and Culture. Deforestation and Erosion Captured in Historical Art of the Pearl River Delta Region, China is an excellent example. Historians look back into paintings created at the time and interpret them to understand the environmental changes occuring in the region. Through these windows into the past we can understand the effects of excessive farming and deforestation. The change of the soil is also tied to the decline of the tiger population in the region. Another way we can look back into history using soil art is through the pigments and paints that have been created from the soil. By exploring the paintings created as well as the pigment we can gain a greater understanding of ancient people and their technologies and lifestyles.</p>
              <p>Although soil art can be used to look into the past, an equally important property to acknowledge is the message the artwork conveys. Interpreting the message a piece of soil art conveys can be the main motivation. Soil art is an especially interesting type of art to read as the degradation of our planet is as extreme as it has ever been. The messages held within soil art are typically loud because the situation is dire. In an effort to increase sustainability, artists involved in soil art look to create environmentally friendly pieces in contrast to previous versions of the genre.</p>
              <p>Protecting our soil is essential to protecting our society. Along with our food supply, it protects other ecosystems, our economy, and the mental wellbeing of our communities. Maintaining our soil requires everyone to be held accountable and to improve the ways that we interact with our environment. Decreasing the amount of greenhouse gasses produced will reduce the degradation of our soil by providing regularity in our climate and inhibiting major weather events. Producing sustainable foods and practicing environmentally friendly farming techniques will be the most direct way to protect our soils. We can promote the protection of our soil by being mindful consumers, reducing our carbon footprint, and supporting laws that benefit the environment.</p>
              <p>Overall, soil art is a window into many parts of the human experience. Soil art can be a pathway for the masses of people to become involved and interested in soil. Promoting soil art and making it accessible to everyone can be the starting point of changing our world and making it a more welcoming place for the future generations.</p>
