               <p>Our project introduces farming, erosion, deforestation, arts of soil like painting and drawings, analysis of the pictures of the time, and some chemical facts about the soil.</p>
               <p>As we saw in the chapter on soil and culture, we learned how south China and the Pearl River Delta region had significant changes to their habitat. Because of the improper practices of clearing land for farming, settlement, erosion, and deforestation changed the region's landscape. Because of this, significant changes were seen in the wildlife too.

                  <h5>Paintings of south China and the Pearl River Delta region</h5>
                  <p>If we look through the paintings created by artists of the area who visited the region, we can clearly observe the Lack of forest cover grass cover, the exposure of rock and root systems, and signs of erosion. By looking at pictures over a large time scale, we can see how the region's land has changed over time.</p>
                  <p>The other topic explores sustainable art from the soil. One example of this negligence is in an artwork that was created by pouring sulfur into and around an abandoned coal mine. As art became more integrated into the earth, artists decided to switch to a more sustainable style of artwork. As sustainability becomes more and more important, the works of art and their message get louder and louder.</p>

               <p>Soil color comes from multiple types of elements in the soil, as mentioned in the video below.</p>
               <p>Reds come from Iron Oxides, blues come from manganese, black and dark colors come from organic matter, and whites come from.
                  Soil color historically has been used to create artwork.</p>
               <div class="col-lg-6">
                  <p>Lastly, when we talk about the soil color historically has been used to create artwork. An example is cave paintings, and scientists used to think that these colors were impurities. Now they believe they are essential elements of the soil. Another way soils can change color is through chemical weathering.</p>
